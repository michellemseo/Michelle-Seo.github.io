    <title>The Lack of Clarity</title>
    </head>
<p class="p1">
We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of 
Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging 
in a large, deeply recessed alcove. So dark are these alcoves, even in bright 
daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do 
is listen to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but 
invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must 
be. Yet the combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one 
of absolute harmony. The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems rather 
to suit the painting perfectly.

For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface upon which 
the faint, frail light can play; it performs precisely the same function as the 
sand-textured wall. This is why we attach such importance to age and patina. 
A new painting, even one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can quite 
destroy the shadows of an alcove, unless it is selected with the greatest care.

A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting, the paper-paneled shoji 
being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, and the alcove where it is darkest. 
Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese room, I marvel at our
 comprehension of the secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of shadow and light. 
For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device. An empty space is 
marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the light drawn into it forms dim 
shadows within emptiness. There is nothing more. And yet, when we gaze into the 
darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the 
shelves, though we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are overcome with the 
feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; 
that here in the darkness immutable tranquility holds sway. The "mysterious Orient" of 
which Westerners speak probably refers to the uncanny silence of these dark places. And 
even we as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into the depths of an 
alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. Where lies the key to this mystery? 
illtimately it is the magic of shadows. Were the shadows to be banished from its comers, 
the alcove would in that instant revert to mere void.

This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light from this empty space 
they imparted to the world of shadows that formed there a quality of mystery and depth 
superior to that of any wall painting or ornament. The technique seems simple, but was 
by no means so simply achieved. We can imagine with little difficulty what 
extraordinary pains were taken with each invisible detail-the placement of the window
in the shelving recess, the depth of the crossbeam, the height of the threshold. But for 
me the most exquisite touch is-the pale white glow of the shoji in the study bay; 
I need only pause before it and I forget the passage of time.</p>

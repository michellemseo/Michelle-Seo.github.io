    <title>Beauty in Shadows</title>
    <p class="c">
    In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow 
    on the earth, and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house. There are of 
    course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep 
    off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they are built to create 
    as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible. 
    If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western house is no more 
    than a cap, with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight to penetrate 
    directly beneath the eaves. There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building 
    materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. The fact that we did not use glass, 
    concrete, and bricks, for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the 
    driving wind and rain. A light room would no doubt have been more convenient 
    for us, too, than a dark room. The quality that we call beauty, however, must 
    always grow from the realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live 
    in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty in shadows, ultimately to 
    guide shadows towards beauty's ends.

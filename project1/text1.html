            I posses no specialized knowledge of architecture, but I understand that 
            in the Gothic cathedral of the West, the roof is thrust up and up so as to 
            place its pinnacle as high in the heavens as possible-and that herein is 
            thought to lie its special beauty. In the temples of Japan, on the other hand, 
            a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, spacious shadows 
            created by the eaves the rest of the structure is built. Nor is this true only 
            of temples; in the palaces of the nobility and the houses of the 
            common people, what first strikes the eye is the massive roof of tile or 
            thatch and the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves. 
            Even at midday cavernous darkness spreads over all beneath the 
            roof's edge, making entryway, doors, walls, and pillars all but invisible. 
            The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the farmhouses 
            of the remote countryside are alike in this respect: like most buildings 
            of the past their roofs give the impression of possessing far 
            greater weight, height, and surface than all that stands beneath the eaves.

            Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a 
            hanging scroll and a flower arrangement. But the scroll and the flowers 
            serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows. We value a 
            scroll above all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, and thus 
            we consider the mounting quite as important as the calligraphy or painting. 
            Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend 
            with the alcove, while a work of no particular distinction may blend 
            beautifully with the room and set off to unexpected advantage both itself 
            and its surroundings. Wherein lies the power of an otherwise ordinary work 
            to produce such an effect? Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of the 
            mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity, and this look of antiquity 
            will strike just the right balance with the darkness of the alcove and room.
